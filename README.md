# Code challenge - Calculate cart
Code challenge - calculate cart, including discounts and delivery

Calculate cart is an application that needs a list of items, some delivery cost rules and some offers and calculates the total based on the input.

Usually you can these data from the database but in this case, it was a simple app so the data is hardcoded into the php file.

Pay attention that the offers are independent (if it's: "buy one red widget, get the second half price", it doesn't mean that if you buy 2 you will get 1 free)

2. Running the cli application

- you can run the code by using `php run.php`
